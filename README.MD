# Predicting Turbofan  Remaining Useful Life (RUL)


the project main theme is to develop a model to perform predictive maintenance on a jet engine. the predictive maintenance approach used here is data-driven, meaning that data collected from the operational jet engine is used to perform predictive maintenance modeling. to be specific, the project aim is to build a predictive model to estimate the Remaining Useful Life ( RUL) of a jet engine based on run-to-failure data of a fleet of similar jet engines

## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation

my motivation behind this small project is to enhance my capability in making models that can be used in predictive maintenance. 

## File Descriptions

The jupyter notebook available here contains the modeling and data exploration 
Data folder contains the datasets

    
## Results

the main findings of the code can be found at the Medium post available [here](https://medium.com/@hamalyas_/jet-engine-remaining-useful-life-rul-prediction-a8989d52f194).
